## Introduction

Memory management is a critical aspect of programming, particularly in low-level languages like C. Proper memory management ensures efficient memory usage, minimizes memory leaks, and enhances program stability.

This repository aims to provide practical examples and explanations of memory management techniques, enabling developers to understand and apply these concepts effectively.

## Examples

Explore the individual examples in the [examples](examples/) directory:

### Chunk Operations

Example: [chunk_operations.c](examples/chunk_operations.c)

Demonstrates memory operations at a chunk level, showcasing techniques for efficient memory handling.

### Dynamic Allocator

Example: [dynamic_allocator.c](examples/dynamic_allocator.c)

Illustrates dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.

### Fault Handler

Example: [fault_handler.c](examples/fault_handler.c)

Covers techniques for handling memory-related faults and exceptions, enhancing program robustness.

### Kernel Heap Management

Example: [kheap.c](examples/kheap.c)

Explores kernel-level heap management techniques, including allocation and deallocation in an operating system context.

### Paging Helpers

Example: [paging_helpers.c](examples/paging_helpers.c)

Provides insights into paging-related memory management, vital in systems with virtual memory.

### Semaphore Manager

Example: [semaphore_manager.c](examples/semaphore_manager.c)

Demonstrates memory management in synchronization scenarios using semaphore structures.

### Shared Memory Manager

Example: [shared_memory_manager.c](examples/shared_memory_manager.c)

Covers shared memory management techniques, essential for inter-process communication.

### User Heap Management

Example: [uheap.c](examples/uheap.c)

Explores memory allocation and deallocation techniques from a user-mode perspective.
